# Car Insurance Policy
Onyx DataDNA August 2023 Challenge
Overview
Our Car Insurance Policy project revolves around leveraging a comprehensive dataset to gain insights in the car insurance domain. By analyzing policyholder data, claim behavior, and demographic attributes, we aim to optimize risk assessment, personalize customer engagement, enhance claims management, and guide strategic decisions. These insights will be presented through an interactive dashboard, empowering stakeholders to make impactful choices based on data-driven intelligence.

Goal
Understanding claim behavior to help with risk assessment and management. This will help identify high-risk policyholders and implement strategies to mitigate risk. In summary, the insights and recommendations from the data analysis can be beneficial to both policyholders and the insurance company. Policyholders can make informed decisions about their coverage and driving habits, while the insurance company can optimize risk assessment, pricing, and customer engagement strategies.
